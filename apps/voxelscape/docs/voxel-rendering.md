# How a voxel becomes a pixel

Read out of the modules that do it at 42a2f85 by `pnpm rendering`.
Every number below is the one the code declares, not a note about it.

An arrow is an import, so it points from a module to one it reads —
which is the reverse of the way the data flows.

## What a block is

|                      |                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| voxels a block       | 64³                                                     |
| world units a voxel  | 2                                                       |
| world units a block  | 128³                                                    |
| border voxels a face | 1, so a block's arrays are 66³ = 287,496 long           |
| bytes a block holds  | 862,488: voxels, skylight and blocklight, one byte each |
| blocks a superchunk  | 2³, which is 256 world units a side                     |

## What a vertex carries

| attribute    | numbers | bytes  |
| ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| `position`   | 3       | 12     |
| `normal`     | 3       | 12     |
| `uv`         | 2       | 8      |
| `tileIndex`  | 1       | 4      |
| `brightness` | 1       | 4      |
| **total**    |         | **40** |

`VERTEX_UPLOAD_BYTES` says 40, which is what the frame's upload budget
spends against. An index costs 4 bytes on top, six to a quad.

## The frame, in the order it is timed

1. `player`
2. `scroll`
3. `flow`
4. `multiplayer`
5. `monsters`
6. `environment`
7. `meshDrain`
8. `merge`
9. `rendererTick`
10. `advance`
11. `occlusion`
12. `draw`

`advance` holds every stage above it except the last two: what the probe
reports as advance is the world's whole update, and `occlusion` and `draw`
are the drawing that follows it.

## What the workers say to each other

| message    | declared in                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `config`   | `world/fill-worker.ts`      |

| `fillMesh` | `world/fill-mesh-worker.ts` |
| `mesh`     | `renderers/mesh.ts`         |

## The numbers that govern it
