// Script events: the replicated fact vocabulary a place's derived rules fold
// over. Each event is an immutable fact — an id, the moment on a clock every
// peer in the place shares, the peer that produced it, and the kind's own
// payload — so any peer can replay the same event set in the same total order
// and compute the same rule state. An event is created once, on the peer that
// observed it, and travels with its id so a duplicate arrival is dropped
// rather than re-applied. The payload keys and their bounds are the contract
// the mesh broadcast and the atproto record both validate against, the same
// way `multiplayer/messages.ts` bounds every wire field.
