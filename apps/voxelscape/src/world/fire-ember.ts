// from it exactly as it does from lava. The copy is written into the containing
// block's store and every block whose meshing border reaches it — the same
// crowd a player edit updates, and for the same reason: each holder culls its
// seam faces against its own copy. The writes are deliberately *not* recorded
// on the edit layer: a fire is scenery for the demo, nothing a player placed,
// so it neither persists, syncs, nor shows up in the edit stream. Because it is
// not an edit, `FireEmbers` also remembers what each voxel held, so a script
// restart can put the floor back instead of leaving a dead ember glowing.
