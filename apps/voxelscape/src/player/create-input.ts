     * strikes. Staying still past the hold grace makes it a hold, which
     * strikes once and again on the repeat cadence while the finger stays put
     * — how a block is broken or a monster is fought by touch. Lifting within
     * the grace makes it a tap, which the world acts on only when the
     * crosshair is over a monster. This is why the returned promise settles
     * when the press ends — awaiting it waits for the finger to lift.
     *
     * Only the first press is followed: a second finger touching down while
     * one is already turning the view starts nothing, so the view turns at the
     * speed of one finger however many are down. Both mouse actions are
     * edge-triggered per press, so holding a mouse button doesn't repeat; the
     * right button's hold is still tracked, so a held secondary can raise a
     * guard.

     * rather than the `movementX`/`movementY` the locked path reads. Those
     * movement values are reported in physical, logical or CSS pixels depending
     * on the browser and the operating system, which would make look sensitivity
     * differ from machine to machine, and Safari on iOS only began reporting
