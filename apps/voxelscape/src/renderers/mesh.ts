// CPU triangle-mesh extraction for the alternative (surface-mesh) renderer.
// Each block's surface is turned into a set of quads — one per exposed face —
// whose positions are in the block's local world space (centred at the origin,
// matching the placement the blocks are drawn at). UVs are baked into
// the atlas using exactly the same face→tile mapping as `rayMarchWorld`, so the
// terrain is lit and textured the same wherever a face is drawn.
//
// Seam faces between neighbouring blocks are culled by reading the block's own
// 1-voxel meshing border (`VoxelStore.padding`), which `fillStore` generates
// from the same world-coordinate terrain function as the interior. The border
// always matches what the neighbour will contain, so no worker needs a
// neighbour's live store to resolve a seam.
//
// Fluids are drawn at the partial height their level calls for: a water or
// lava cell resting on ground sits as thin as `1/8` of a voxel at its seventh
// level of spread, its top surface drops one level per cell, and a cell with
// open air below it is a falling column and draws full height. Water faces go
// to the translucent water pass; lava, which is opaque and textured, is
// emitted into the terrain pass so it shares the terrain material and the
// opaque draw order.
