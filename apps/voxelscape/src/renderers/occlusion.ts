// dependency so it can be unit-tested by feeding it synthetic readbacks.
//
// The culler learns what is visible by drawing the world's chunks into an
// offscreen target in one flat colour each — the chunk's slot id packed into a
// 24-bit RGB value — reading the pixels back, and keeping the set of ids that
// actually won a pixel. A chunk whose id never appears is behind something
// else, real or probe, and is not drawn on the main pass until a later query
// sees it again. The probe uses the very geometry the world draws, so it can
// only ever hide a chunk that is genuinely covered: visibility is read off the
// same depth the real render uses, not guessed in the CPU.
