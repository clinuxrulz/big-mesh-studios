// Publishing places and reading them back over atproto. The read half mirrors
// `models.ts`: a place lives in its author's repository, its record and its zip
// both public, so listing a place or booting its world costs nothing but the
// author's name. The write half is what publishing is — uploading the zip and
// putting the record it describes under a key made from its name — and needs
// the signed-in account, unlike reading, so the two halves are separate
// objects: `PlaceLibrary` for anyone, `PlacePublisher` for an account of one's
// own.
